1. Watch this short video on the printing press: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN_KhB9SjVs>

In the video, on this small scale-model printing press, the curator prints a single page of text on a small sheet of paper. But as we discussed, early modern printers used very *large* sheets of paper and printed multiple pages at once, folding them later to create books.

2. Fold an 8-page "quarto" book by hand. Number the pages, unfold them, and draw or write a short book so that when you fold it back up everything is in the right order. 

3. Now let's scale up by trying this with two different kinds of books: a quarto and a folio. Complete Exercise 1 of the [DIY First Folio](https://diyfirstfolio.folger.edu/) and [DIY Quarto](https://diyquarto.folger.edu/).
