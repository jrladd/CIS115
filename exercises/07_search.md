Go to [this Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_nfxNJDlRdN2_yKpwHOndeHU9lcsLt_9?usp=sharing) to complete the exercise.

As always, **don't hesitate to put your hand up if you have any questions or run into any problems**. If something isn't working right just let me know right away and don't stress about it. We'll work together to fix the problem. The goal isn't to become programmers today---we're just getting a feel for how search works!
