**Complete by: Wednesday 27 Mar., at class time.**  

Revision is an essential part of the writing process. Now that you have read more about the history of computing and reflected on your initial [Historical Essay](/assignments/historical essay), you will **revise** your essay into a more in-depth reflection on your chosen topic. Use the feedback you received from your peers and from me to expand your original piece of writing.

Your resulting essay should be at least 300 words longer than your original, but this **does *not* mean you should simply add a new paragraph or section**. Instead, *revise the whole essay*: consider reconfiguring the structure, rewriting individual sentences, adding new details, removing sections that aren't working and replacing them, reinterpreting quotes or adding new ones, and expanding your analysis. You may add an additional source, but this is not required (and in some cases, this may not be the right thing to do). We will discuss revision strategies in class and in our one-on-one conferences, but/and if you're unsure about how to revise your essay you can always reach out to me.

Remember that you can continue to use [the LibGuide for our class](https://libguides.washjeff.edu/CIS100).
